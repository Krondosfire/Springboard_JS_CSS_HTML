		<h1>Events Exercise</h1>
		<div><p>In this exercise:

			- The user should be able to set a color for boxes (this affects both current boxes and new boxes).
			- The user should be able to add boxes with the set color to the div with the ID `box-container`:
				- When the button with the ID `new-box-button` is clicked.
				- When the `N` key is pressed.
			- The user should be able to remove a box when the box is double-clicked on.
			- Each box should display its ID.
			- Each box should display its page coordinates when hovered (when the mouse leaves, it displays its ID back).
			- Each box should have a class `box` for styling and selecting.
			
			We coded the `index.html` and `style.css` files in the starter code for you. Before you start coding the `script.js` file, please review the `index.html` file.
			
			After you try on your own, please see the steps if you need guidance on the steps you should follow.</p></div>
