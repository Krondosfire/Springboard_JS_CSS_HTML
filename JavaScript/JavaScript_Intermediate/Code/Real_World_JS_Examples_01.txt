Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. Petrol pumps are numbered 0 to (N-1)(both inclusive).
You have two pieces of information corresponding to each of the petrol pump: (1) the amount of petrol that particular petrol pump will give, and (2)
the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump. Initially, you have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol.
You can start the tour at any of the petrol pumps. Calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle.
Consider that the truck will stop at each of the petrol pumps. The truck will move one kilometer for each litre of the petrol.
Input format: The first line will contain the value of N. The next N lines will contain a pair of integers each, i.e. the amount of petrol that 
petrol pump will give and the distance between that petrol pump and the next petrol pump.
Constraints: 1<=N<=10^5, 1<=amount of petrol, distance<=10^9.
Output format: An integer which will be the smallest index of the petrol pump from which we can start the tour.

Given pointers to the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single, sorted linked list. 
Either head pointer may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

Example
 headA refers to 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> NULL
 headB refers to 1 --> 2 --> NULL

The new list is 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 7 --> NULL

Function Description

Complete the mergeLists function in the editor below.

mergeLists has the following parameters:

* SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headA: a reference to the head of a list
* SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headB: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

* SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the merged list
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
The format for each test case is as follows:
The first line contains an integer n, the length of the first linked list.
The next n lines contain an integer each, the elements of the linked list.
The next line contains an integer m, the length of the second linked list.

A queue is an abstract data type that maintains the order in which elements were added to it, allowing the oldest elements to be removed from 
the front and new elements to be added to the rear. This is called a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure because the first element added 
to the queue (i.e., the one that has been waiting the longest) is always the first one to be removed.

A basic queue has the following operations:

* Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
* Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.
In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process q queries, where each query is one of the following 3 types:

1 x: Enqueue element x into the end of the queue.
2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains a single query in the form described in the problem statement above. 
All three queries start with an integer denoting the query type, but only query 1 is followed by an additional space-separated value, x, 
denoting the value to be enqueued.
Constraints:
1 <= q <= 10^5
1 <= type <= 3
1 <= |x| <= 10^9
It is guaranteed that a valid answer always exists for each query of type 3.

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a 
closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced 
because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, 
(, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

It contains no unmatched brackets.
The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. 
Otherwise, return NO.

Function Description:

Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

string s: a string of brackets
Returns:

string: either YES or NO
Input Format:

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of strings.
Each of the next n lines contains a single string s, a sequence of brackets.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= |s| <= 10^3, where |s| is the length of the sequence.
All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.

Objective
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Example
mealCoast = 100
tipPercent = 15
taxPercent = 8

A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

Function Description
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

Input Format

There are 3 lines of numeric input:
The first line has a double, mealCoast (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).

Implement a simple text editor. The editor initially contains an empty string, . Perform  operations of the following 4 types:

1. append(W) - Append string S to the end of .
2. delete(k) - Delete the last S characters of .
3. print k-th - Print the  character of S.
4. undo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, Q, denoting the number of operations.
Each line i of the Q subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < Q) defines an operation to be performed. 
Each operation starts with a single integer, t (where t e{1,2,3,4}), denoting a type of operation as defined in the Problem Statement above. 
If the operation requires an argument, t is followed by its space-separated argument. For example, if t = 1 and W="abcd", line i will be 1 abcd.
Constraints
1 <= Q <= 10^6
1 <=k <= |S|
The sum of the lengths of all W in the input <= 10^6.
The sum of k over all delete operations <=2*10^6.
All input characters are lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sequence of operations given as input is possible to perform.

Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value k. 
To do this, two cookies with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:
sweetness =(1 * Least sweet cookie + 2 * 2nd least sweet cookie).
This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness >= k.
Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required. If it is not possible, return -1.
Example: k = 9; A = [2,7,3,6,4,6]
The smallest values are 2,3.
Remove them then return 2 + 2 * 3 = 8 to the array. Now A = [8,7,6,4,6].
Remove 4,6 and return 4 + 6 * 2 = 16 to the array. Now A = [16,8,7,6].
Remove 6,7, return 6 + 2 * 7 = 20 and A = [20,16,8,7].
Finally, remove 8,7 and return 7 + 2 * 8 = 23 to A. Now A = [23,20,16].
All values are >= k = 9 so the process stops after 4 iterations. Return 4.

Consider an undirected graph where each edge weighs 6 units. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively from 1 to n.
You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected graph.
After you create a representation of the graph, you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given starting position using
the breadth-first search algorithm(BFS). Return an array of distances from the start node in node number order. If a node is unreachable, 
return -1 for that node.
Example: n = 5 // number of nodes; m = 3 // number of edges; edges = [1,2],[1,3],[3,4]; s = 1 // starting node. 
All distances are from the start node 1. Outputs are calculated for distances to nodes 2 through 5: [6,6,12,-1]. Each edge is 6 units, 
and the unreachable node 5 has the required return distance of -1.
Function Description:
Complete the bfs function in the editor below. If a node is unreachable, its distance is -1.
BFS has the following parameters:
int n: the number of nodes;
int m: the number of edges;
int edges[m][2]: start and end nodes for edges;
int s: the node to start traversals from.
Returns:
The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries. Each of the following q sets of lines has the following format:
* The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, the number of nodes and edges in the graph;
* Each line i of the m subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers, u and v, that describe an edge between nodes u and v;
* The last line contains a single integer, s, the node number to start from.
