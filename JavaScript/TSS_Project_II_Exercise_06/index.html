    <h1><span>Ceasar's VIP Guest Directory</span></h1>
    <h6>As Caesar's annual party ðŸŽ‰ grew in prominence, attendees included dignitaries and VIPs from various regions. 
        To manage this extensive list and maintain the event's exclusivity, Caesar needed a more sophisticated system.

        He contemplated using objects ðŸ“¦ in JavaScript, as they allowed him to store detailed profiles of each guest, 
        including their titles, regions, dietary preferences, and the gifts they'd bestowed upon him.
        
        However, as with any VIP list, there were occasional changes. Some dignitaries fell out of favor and had to be discreetly removed from the list.</h6>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <div><span>Initial Guest Directory:</span></div>
        <li> let const guests = {<br>
            ANTONY: { <br>
              title: "General",<br>
              region: "Rome",<br>
              dietaryPreference: "Vegetarian",<br>
              pastGifts: ["Golden Laurel", "Chariot"]<br>
            },<br>
            CICERO: {<br>
              title: "Orator",<br>
              region: "Arpinum",<br>
              dietaryPreference: "Omnivore",<br>
              pastGifts: ["Scroll of Proverbs", "Quill"]<br>
            }<br>
          };
          </li>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <div><span> Add "BRUTUS" to the guest directory. He's a "Senator" from "Rome", prefers "Vegan" food, and in the past, he has gifted Caesar a "Silver Dagger" and a "Marble Bust".</span></div>
        <div><li>guestList.unshift("BRUTUS");</li></div>    

        
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <div><span>Update CICERO's past gifts to include a "Golden Lyre".</span></div>
    <li>guests.CICERO.pastGifts.push("Golden Lyre");</li>
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <div><span>Retrieve the region of "ANTONY".</span></div>
    <li>const antonyRegion = guests.ANTONY.region;</li>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <div><span>Due to unforeseen political events, "CICERO" needs to be discreetly removed from the guest list.</span></div>
    <li>delete guests.CICERO;</li>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <div><span>Assign ANTONY's profile to a new variable named generalProfile. Then, using this new variable, change the region of ANTONY to "Egypt".</span></div>
    <li>const generalProfile = guests.ANTONY;</li>
    <li>generalProfile.region = "Egypt";</li>

    



            <h4>Question </h4>
            <div><span>After executing Step 5, what will be the region of ANTONY in the original guests object?</span></div>
            <h4>Answer </h4>
                <div><span>The region of ANTONY in the original guests object will be "Egypt".</span></div> 
            
            

    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
    <div><label>The act of deleting or discreetly removing names from public records and inscriptions in ancient Rome was known as "Damnatio memoriae" 
        (condemnation of memory). It was a form of dishonor that could be passed by the Roman Senate on traitors or those who brought discredit to Rome. 
        Their statues might be destroyed, their names obliterated from inscriptions, and even their faces chiseled off from mosaics. 
        In our modern times, while we simply use a delete keyword in programming, in ancient Rome, it was a much more laborious and symbolic act! ðŸ—¿ðŸ”¨</label></div>
