    <h1><span>Caesar's Cipher Reloaded</span></h1>
    <h6>In ancient Rome üèõÔ∏è, Julius Caesar was impressed by the effectiveness of his cipher. But as the secret parties grew more popular üéâ, 
        manually shifting each letter became tedious. It was time for automation! Caesar summoned his best scribes and mathematicians üìú 
        to design a system - a system that could encrypt and decrypt messages at will!</h6>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <div><span>It is given the following code:</span></div>
        <li> const friend = "BRUTUS";<br>
             const shiftValue = 3;<br>
             const alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";<br>
          </li>
          <div><span>Incorporate the following steps into a single JavaScript file, placing the provided code at the top. 
            Insert your answers to the questions as comments where they appear.</span></div>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <div><span> Create a function named encryptLetter that takes a letter and a shift value as parameters. This function should return the encrypted version of the letter.</span></div>
        <div><li>function encryptLetter (letter, shift)<br>
            {<br>
              const index = alphabet.indexOf(letter.toLowerCase());<br>
              const newIndex = (index + shift) % alphabet.length;<br>
              return alphabet[newIndex];<br>
            }</li></div>    

        
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <div><span>Create a function named encryptMessage that takes a word and a shift value as parameters. This function should return the encrypted version of the entire word.</span></div>
    <li>function encryptMessage (word, shift)<br>
        {<br>
          let encryptedMessage = "";<br>
          for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++)<br>
          {<br>
            encryptedMessage += encryptLetter(word[i], shift);<br>
          }<br>
          return encryptedMessage;<br>
        }<br>
        </li>
    
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <div><span>Create a function named decryptLetter that takes an encrypted letter and a shift value as parameters. This function should return the decrypted version of the letter.</span></div>
        <li>function decryptLetter (letter, shift)<br>
            {<br>
              const index = alphabet.indexOf(letter.toLowerCase());<br>
              const newIndex = (index - shift + alphabet.length) % alphabet.length;<br>
              return alphabet[newIndex];<br>
            }<br>
            </li>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <div><span>Create a function named decryptMessage that takes an encrypted word and a shift value as parameters. This function should return the decrypted version of the entire word.</span></div>
            <li>function decryptMessage (word, shift)<br>
                {<br>
                  let decryptedMessage = "";<br>
                  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++)<br>
                  {<br>
                    decryptedMessage += decryptLetter(word[i], shift);<br>
                  }<br>
                  return decryptedMessage;<br>
                }<br>
                </li>
            <h4>Question</h4>
                <div><span>If Caesar encrypts the word "BRUTUS" using our encryptMessage function and then decrypts the result using our decryptMessage function, will he get "BRUTUS" back?
                     Why or why not?</span></div>
            <h4>Answer</h4>
                <div><span>Yes, Caesar will get "BRUTUS" back. The decryption function is the inverse of the encryption function. 
                    When applied sequentially, they cancel each other out, restoring the original message.</span></div> 
            
            <h4></h4>
                <div><span></span></div>
            <h4></h4>
                <div><span></span></div> 
    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
    <div><label>While the Caesar Cipher was groundbreaking in its time, today's encryption standards are far more sophisticated. 
        One would need more than a simple shift in the alphabet to decode modern encrypted communications. 
        In fact, modern encryption algorithms, when used correctly, can take billions of years to crack, even with today's most advanced computers!</label></div>
